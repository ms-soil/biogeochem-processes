### Background
This study was done on oil-palm plantations in Indonesia on two differen soil types.

### The code
Let's fist load our library. It is the tidyverse library, which includes useful tools for data handling and visualization, i.e. the ggplot 2 package.

```{r libraries, echo = T}
library("tidyverse")
```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
